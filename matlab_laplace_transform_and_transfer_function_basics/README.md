# matlab_laplace_transform_and_transfer_function_basics
A collection of scripts for understanding the Laplace Transform and Inverse Laplace Transform functions, Transfer functions, their different representations and pole-zero diagrams in Matlab.

The following functions and scripts are contained in this file:
  * LaplaceTransform.m
  * InverseLaplaceTransform.m
  * TransferFunction.m
  * TransferFunctions_tf_zpk.m
  * PoleZeroPlot.m
 
### LaplaceTransform.m
A script for understanding the Laplace Transform function, `laplace()` in Matlab.

### InverseLaplaceTransform.m
A script for understanding the Inverse Laplace Transform function, `ilaplace()` in Matlab.

### TransferFunction.m
A script for understanding the Transfer function, `tf()` in Matlab.

### TransferFunctions_tf_zpk.m
A script for understanding two different transfer functions in Matlab. The `tf()` function and the `zpk()` function. We use different example functions to demonstrate the difference between the two.

### PoleZeroPlot.m
A script for understanding the `pzplot()` function in Matlab. We use different transfer functions to plot the zero-pole graphs via `pzplot()`.
